# For this exercise

# Write a function (guessing_game) that takes no arguments.
# When run, the function chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
# Then ask the user to guess what number has been chosen.
# Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of the following:
# Too high
# Too low
# Just right
# If the user guesses correctly, the program exits. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.
# The program only exits after the user guesses correctly.
# Weâ€™ll use the randint (http://mng.bz/mBEn) function in the random module to generate a random number.
