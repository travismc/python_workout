# Create a function, passwd_to_csv, that takes two filenames as arguments: the first is a passwd-style file to read from, and the second is the name of a file in which to write the output.

# The new fileâ€™s contents are the username (index 0) and the user ID (index 2). Note that a record may contain a comment, in which case it will not have anything at index 2; you should take that into consideration when writing the file. The output file should use TAB characters to separate the elements. You can assume that any line with at least two colon-separated fields is legitimate.

import csv


def passwd_to_csv(passwd_filename, csv_filename):
    with open(passwd_filename) as passwd, open(csv_filename, 'w') as output:
        infile = csv.reader(passwd, delimiter=':')
        outfile = csv.writer(output, delimiter='\t')
        for record in infile:
            if len(record) > 1:
                outfile.writerow((record[0], record[2]))
