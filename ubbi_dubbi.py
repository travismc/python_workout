# In Ubbi Dubbi, every vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) is prefaced with ub. Thus milk becomes mubilk (m-ub-ilk) and program becomes prubogrubam (prub-ogrub-am). In theory, you only put an ub before every vowel sound, rather than before each vowel. Given that this is a book about Python and not linguistics, I hope that youâ€™ll forgive this slight difference in definition.
